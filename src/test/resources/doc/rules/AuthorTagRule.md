For style purposes, every author.xml file must contain an <author> tag as the
root element. This tag should also have the 'name' and 'creationDate'
attributes. For example:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8">
    <author name="Steve Holt" creationDate="2013-09-28">
      .. content ..
    </author>
